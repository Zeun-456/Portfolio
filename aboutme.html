      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        Hi! I'm Ellie Song, a game developer based in Australia. I have a burning passion for game design and development , 
        and I love creating immersive experiences that bring joy to players. My journey in game development started with a fascination 
        for game playing, particularly Nintendo games (it sounds cliche but Mario games were my favourite), and it has grown into a full-fledged dream where I can combine my creativity with technical skills. 
        I am also a skilled artist, thus I enjoy adding my own creativity to creating and designing levels/maps, characters, cover arts and more.
        I hope to fulfill my dream of becoming a game designer and developer that can reach out to many people and make them happy through my games.
      </p>
